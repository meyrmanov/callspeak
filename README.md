Calls Peak Application
==========================

Application reads input text file with the calls information in the following format [start:end] and detects the peak of simultaneous calls.

## Detailed requirements

We want to write a program that detects the peak of simultaneous incoming calls reaching a large call-center.
The call-center activity is consolidated in a text file (call log) whose lines are structured as follows:
[start:end]
where "start" and "end" are integers, representing the timestamps of the call start and the call ending.
"end" is always superior to " start " and the lines are ordered by start time.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple short call log:
1385718405:1385718491
1385718407:1385718409
1385718408:1385718452
1385718408:1385718464
1385718413:1385718452

The actual file could contain tens or hundreds of thousands of lines and span across a large period of
time, up to several weeks.
The program reads the input file and simply displays the maximum number of simultaneous calls
(active at the same second) occurring on the period covered by the call log, and the period(s) on
which it is reached.

Example of an expected result:
The peak for this call log is 23 simultaneous calls, that occurred between 1385718408 and
1385718412.

No library is allowed, everything must be coded by hand.

You will deliver that program as you would on a classic development project. It should be
immediately runnable and testable.

## Run
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.args=samples/calls.txt

## Tests
mvn test
